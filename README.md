# FLAMES finder(Java)

This is a simple **Java program** that calculates the relationship between two names based on the classic **FLAMES** game

---

## ðŸ’¡ How It Works

1. The user enters **two names**.
2. The program removes **common letters** from both names.
3. It counts the **remaining letters**.
4. Then, using the FLAMES logic, it eliminates one relationship at a time in a circular pattern until only one remains.
5. The final remaining word (e.g., *Love*, *Friends*, etc.) is displayed as the result.
